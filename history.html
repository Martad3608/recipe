     <h2>Health </h2>
     <h4>Native Americans already used these berries in their cooking. Some have concluded that European immigrants started using the wild blueberries in place of bilberries in their baking, including muffins.Blueberries offer health benefits. They contain vitamin C, high levels of disease-fighting antioxidants and fiber. In addition they have very little fat. Disadvantages may outweigh advantages when the blueberries are baked into batter that is made of high-fat ingredients, such as butter, milk and sugar. Instead boost the benefits of a blueberry muffin by choosing a variety that includes healthier ingredients. Suggestions include skim milk, nuts, bran or wheat flour.

<h2>Fun Fact </h2>

As part of a study of state foods in a social studies class, third-graders from Carlton, Minnesota's South Terrace Elementary School suggested that the blueberry muffin should be the official state muffin. Acting on the initiative, the Minnesota legislature in 1988 so designated the blueberry muffin
